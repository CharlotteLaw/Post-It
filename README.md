# Post-It
Post-It is a full-stack web application that allows users to create accounts, **post** their thoughts, and engage with other users' ideas through comments. Express, share, and connect!

## How it Works  

**Back End**
* Programmed using Typescript 
* Deployed PostgreSQL database on [Railway](https://railway.app/)
* Used NextAuth.js for creating and authorizing users
* Used [Prisma](https://authjs.dev/reference/adapter/prisma) as an adapter for NextAuth.js to connect to the PostgreSQL database. 

**Front End**
* Embedded HTML and CSS within Typescript as the web application
* Utilized [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/) as the React framework
